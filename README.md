# Linear-mixed-effects-model

The dataset MON810.csv consists of several measurements made during a subchronic toxicity study concerning the MON810 maize.
The sales1.csv consists of quarterly sales volumes (in % and indexed to the time 0) of a product.
The dataset sales30.csv now consists of quarterly sales volumes (still in % and indexed to the time 0) of 30 different products.

Based on these three datasets, in R, I applied hypthesis testing (using Student + Fisher + Wilcoxon tests), linear regression models and linear mixed effects models.
